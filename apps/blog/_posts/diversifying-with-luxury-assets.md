## Brands reaching all time highs despite the pandemic, the economic crisis and conflicts
While some industries struggle a lot recently (EXAMPLE), luxury worldwide groups have published quite good results this year, Hermes and LVMH leading the way with an improvement of respectively 33% and 29% compared to 2021. Over the recent years, luxury brands and their assets have proven to be a safe reserve of investment and have even outpace traditionnal investments indexes lately. An impressive performance considering that a lot of their key markets are still recovering from the pandemic and some are in prey of geopolitical conflict. China, the biggest market for luxury goods, is still battling the pandemic and hasn't reached pre pandemic levels yet in terms of tourism and consumption. In Europe, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine is still ongoing and weighs on the European economy. 

Despite all of this, consumerism is still alive and well, and luxury brands have been able to adapt to a new digital environment and enhance their digital engagement with their customers. 

"With China, it's not a question of demand - the demand is there. But it's a question of how the health situation and the restrictions evolve," Bernard Arnault said. 
Chinese consumers accounted for 30% of all luxury sales in 2018, according to Bain & Co.

"The momentum for the key markets in North America, Europe and Japan is growing, while China was very advantageous until the end of February," RBC consultants said earlier this month.

## Demand for luxury assets is growing
"Today the entire world buys luxury products and that is continuing with an even younger clientele, which is an advantage in this sector," Arnaud Cadart, a portfolio manager for Flornoy.

As economic disparities increase and younger clientele is targeted, we are witnessing a surge in demand for luxury assets. The market is expected to keep growing with a steady rise of 21 percent to finally reach $1.45 Trillion at the end of 2022. All of the luxury categories have now outperformed or recovered to their 2019 levels.

## Winning in the long run

The luxury market is a very resilient one, and has proven to be a good investment in the long run. The pandemic has been a good test for the industry, and it has proven capable of reinvention to emerge even stronger than before. It just seems like these assets are recession-proof.

"We could be affected in the short term, but we're not worried on the long term," said Jean-Jacques Guiony, LVMH's financial director.
